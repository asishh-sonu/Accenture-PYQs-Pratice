Rohan is a kid who has just learned about creating words from
alphabets. He has written some words in the notepad of his Father
laptop. Now his father wants to find the longest word written by Rohan
using a computer program. Write a program to find the longest string
in a given list of strings.
Example:
Input: yes no number
Output: The longest string is: number

Answer ----------
import java.util.Scanner;
public class LongestWordfinder{
    public static String findLongestWord(String[] words){
        String longestword = "";
        for (String word : words){
            if(word.length()>longestword.length()){
                longestword= word;
            }
        }
        return longestword;
    }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the words separated by spaces:");
        String input = scanner.nextLine(); // Input: yes no number
        
        String[] words = input.split(" "); // Split the input into words based on spaces
        String longestWord = findLongestWord(words); // Call the function to find the longest word

        System.out.println("The longest string is: " + longestWord); // Output the longest string
        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
    
}





for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    String word = words[i];
    if (word.length() > longestWord.length()) {
        longestWord = word;
    }
}
