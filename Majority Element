You are the head of the election committee in your village. Each political party is associated with a unique number, 
and the votes are represented as an integer array A where each element contains the party number voted for by the villagers.
For a party to win, they must have a majority of votes i.e. more than half or equal to the half of the total votes cast in the election. 
Your task is to find and return an integer value denoting the winning party's number. Return -1 if there is no party with a majority.

Input Specification: 
input1: An integer value representing the number of voters 
input2: An integer array A representing the votes of the voters 
Output Specification:
Return an integer value denoting the winning party's number.
Return -1 if there is no party with a majority.

Example 1:
input1: 7
input2: (1,2,2,2,3,3,2)
Output: 2
