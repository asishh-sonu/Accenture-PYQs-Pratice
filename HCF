You have been given two integers.
You have to calculate the the Highest Common Divisors , Which is also known as HCF
Example :
input :
a:
675
b:
835
Output: 5


Answer --- 
public class Asish{
    public static int calculateHCF(int a, int b){
        while(b != 0){
            int temp = b;
            b = a %b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int a = 675;
        int b = 835;
        int hcf = calculateHCF(a,b);
        System.out.println(hcf);
    }
}
